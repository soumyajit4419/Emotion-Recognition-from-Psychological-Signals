# Wavelet Transformation :- 

The Wavelet transform is similar to the Fourier transform with a completely different merit function. The main difference is this: Fourier transform decomposes the signal into sines and cosines, i.e. the functions localized in Fourier space; in contrary the wavelet transform uses functions that are localized in both the real and Fourier space. 

Types of Wavelet Transform is divided into 2 classes:

- **Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)**
- **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)**
